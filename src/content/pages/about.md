## Aditya Sharma - Electronics Grad

**Greetings!** I'm Aditya, a  core electronics & electrical engineer with a deep passion for technology and innovation.
## Skills and Expertise

Expertise spanning worked on CNT in **Nanotech**, Designing circuits for **RF** & **Analog** systems, to work with firmware, RTOS, and protocols of **Embedded systems**, and enhancing **Robot Choreography** in robotics, also complemented by a strong foundation in **Nuclear**, and **Plasma** physics. Proficient in simulation environments enabling robust design and analysis across diverse technological domains.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I have hands-on experience with FPGA-based, real-time SDR systems, and biosensors. I leverage testing simulation environments like TCAD for biosensors, and open Monte Carlo methods to design, analyze, and optimize complex systems of nuclear reactors.


## Interested/Open to:

> A research assistant/intern position at a Semiconductor, Embedded(RF/Analog), or Physics(Plasma/Nuclear) area.
> If you want to collaborate on research papers, Articles, etc.
> Cool Projects.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication. Whether working with clients, designers, or fellow developers, I value clear communication to ensure the success of every project.
