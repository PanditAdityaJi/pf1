**Project Overview**
novel approaches to system integration, state estimation techniques, and power management strategies. Results demonstrate significant system efficiency, reliability, and battery longevity improvements through the proposed integrated approach. The study contributes to developing a more sustainable and efficient EV charging infrastructure powered by solar energy.

## Objectives

1. Grid integration issues such as voltage stability concerns, power quality management, reverse power flow scenarios, and the system's response to rapid load changes need to be addressed.
2. The complexities of battery management, including accurate state estimation, thermal management, cell balancing optimization, and charging/discharging control, further complicate the integration of solar-powered EV charging.
