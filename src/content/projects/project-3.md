**Project Overview:**
novel approaches to system integration, state estimation techniques, and power management strategies. Results demonstrate significant system efficiency, reliability, and battery longevity improvements through the proposed integrated approach. The study contributes to developing a more sustainable and efficient EV charging infrastructure powered by solar energy.

## Objectives

1. solar power generation is inherently variable, with intermittent patterns and weather-dependent reliability, leading to a mismatch between generation and demand peaks.
2. grid integration issues such as voltage stability concerns, power quality management, reverse power flow scenarios, and the system's response to rapid load changes need to be addressed.
3. complexities of battery management, including accurate state estimation, thermal management, cell balancing optimization, and charging/discharging control, further complicate the integration of solar-powered EV charging.
   
## Outcome

The contributions of this work are crucial for the development of a more sustainable and resilient EV charging infrastructure powered by solar energy. The integrated MPPT-BMS solution presented in this paper represents a significant step towards realizing the full potential of solar-powered EV charging networks, paving the way for a future with cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable transportation systems.
