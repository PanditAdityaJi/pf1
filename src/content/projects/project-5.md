**Project Overview:**
Master MSP430 coordinates data collection from multiple slave nodes through interrupt-driven SPI communication. Each slave node independently monitors environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, light) with optimized sampling rates, entering ultra-low-power modes between readings.

## Objectives

1. Create an immersive online gallery experience specifically tailored for pixel art enthusiasts and NFT collectors.
2. Utilize blockchain technology to authenticate and secure ownership of digital artworks, ensuring a transparent and tamper-proof art marketplace.
3. Foster a community of digital artists and art collectors, providing a platform for collaboration, appreciation, and exchange.
