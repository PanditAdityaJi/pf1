**Project Overview:**
A dancing bot is an artificial intelligence-powered robot or software application that is designed to move and dance in response to music or other stimuli. These bots use sophisticated techniques to analyze music and interpret the beats and rhythms, and then generate synchronized dance moves that are fluid and expressive. Dancing bots can take many different forms, from humanoid robots with articulated limbs to virtual avatars that move on a computer screen. They can also be programmed to respond to user input, such as hand gestures or voice commands, making them interactive and engaging.


## Objectives

 1. Implementing a program using C++ and the Xbee module requires a combination of programming skills and hardware expertise.
 2. By using C++ and the Xbee module, robotics engineers can create sophisticated control systems that enable robots to operate in formations and perform complex tasks.
