**Project Overview:**
Software-defined radio is a paradigm where radio communication system components that have typically been implemented in hardware (e.g., mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or embedded system.
## Objectives

1. Develop a modular and flexible SDR implementation.
2. Replace traditional hardware with software solutions for radio processing.
3. Provide a base for further research and development in the field of SDR.
